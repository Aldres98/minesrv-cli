# minesrv-cli

**minesrv-cli** is a simple CLI tool, which allows you to download minecraft server mod packs from the forge, via API. The main intention for creating this tool was a hard time I experienced while trying to download a modded server from Forge to Ubuntu Server machine directly, without a need to transfer it via ftp/scp. 

# Usage
 Just run the following commands and follow prompts:
 
 `npm i minesrv-cli -g`
  `minesrv-cli`
